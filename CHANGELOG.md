## ChangeLog

* Rename `SetLogFile` to `SetFile` to reduce redundancy.

* `Transaction` now implements an `Ignore` method which will prevent
  any of the transaction's data from being recorded.

* `Transaction` now implements a subset of the interfaces
  `http.CloseNotifier`, `http.Flusher`, `http.Hijacker`, and `io.ReaderFrom`
  to match the behavior of its wrapped `http.ResponseWriter`.

## 0.4.0

* Queue time support added: if the inbound request contains an
`"X-Request-Start"` or `"X-Queue-Start"` header with a unix timestamp, the
agent will report queue time metrics.  Queue time will appear on the
application overview chart.  The timestamp may fractional seconds,
milliseconds, or microseconds: the agent will deduce the correct units.
